<h1>Airport Simulator</h1>

<p>
 This project was created as an assignment I received from the college I attended.
</p>

<h2>
  What does the application do?
  </h2>
  <p>
  This is a simulator that simulates a control screen in an airport control tower.
The airport has a runway with 8 stations where some of the stations are used for both the landing runway and the takeoff runway.
Stations 6 and 7 are parallel to each other and it is possible to use both to exit the runway to the terminal after landing or to exit the terminal in order to get on the runway and take off.
    The app's biggest task is to manage the route so that planes don't collide or interfere with each other.
